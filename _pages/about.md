<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an independent researcher. My research interests lie in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and AI/Deep Learning. 

I was a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) at [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), under the supervision of [Dr. Thivya Kandappu](https://www.thivyak.info/) and [Dr. Ma Dong](https://www.dongma.info/). I also worked closely with [Dr. Guohao Lan](https://guohao.netlify.app/). My research areas were Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Pervasive Sensing. However, I chose to withdraw from the PhD program because of some personal issues. 

Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). During my studies, I focused on Computer Vision and Vision-Language Processing in the Intelligent Vision Information Processing (IVIP) Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Hongliang Li](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1450/11693.htm).

# üöÄ Projects

## Gaze-Aided Low-Vision Assistance 
*Jan 2024 - Nov 2024*

Project leader
- Aimed at designing a low-vision assistive system, which can assist the user‚Äôs gaze movements. Afterward, it changed to implement a visual impairment early detection system. 
- Conducted 3 pilot studies and 1 formal data collection study; Implemented a web-based interface for experiments; Arranged a schedule and collected eye movement data from 40 participants. 
- Extracted over 20 eye movement features; Utilized many statistical analytic methods to analyze eye movement data; Designed some machine learning and deep learning-based models to classify gaze features.
