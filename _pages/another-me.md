## My MBTI

**INTJ**. It has been pretty stable now. 

## My Pseudonyms

I usually use these names on social media, and I am also glad to be called by them:
- Chinese: 柳笛 (liu di)
- English: Willow
- Japanese: 柳原 晴樹 (yanagiwara haruki)

## My Hobbies

### Riichi Mahjong

I have a strong interest on Riichi Mahjong (Japanese Mahjong), and am eager to play it professionally as pros. 

I am currently a *five-dan (五段)* player on the prestigious Riichi Mahjong platform [Tenhou](https://tenhou.net/) (ID: みかんはら) and *Saint 1 (雀圣1)* player on MajSoul (ID: 柳笛willow). 

### Boardgames

I am into playing boardgames, especially funny and interesting games that can laugh together with my friends. 

I prefer simple games, thematic games, role-playing game (RPG). My list:

- [Betrayal at House on the Hill](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill)（山中小屋/山屋惊魂）
- [Blood on the Clocktower](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240980/blood-on-the-clocktower) （染·钟楼谜团/血染钟楼）
- [Paranormal Detectives](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/280136/paranormal-detectives) （灵能侦探）
- [Millions of Dollars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193213/millions-of-dollars) （百万美金）
- [Top Ten](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/300905/top-ten) （脑洞量表）
- [Telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations) （传情画意）

As the old saying goes: The most difficult thing is to find **FRIENDS** to play...

### Sports

Except for running and swimming...

**Cycling** Although I am not a professional racer, I really like cycling in the city, which is super chill. My ride: Brompton C-Line 12.

**Diving** I got the open water (OW) diving certificate in 2020, before I learn how to swim... (Funny, isn't it? :P)
